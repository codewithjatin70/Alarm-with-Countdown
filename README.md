# Alarm-with-Countdown
Alarm with Countdown is a beginner-friendly Python project that allows users to set an alarm for a specific number of seconds. Once the countdown completes, the program reminds the user to complete their task with a custom message. It uses Pythonâ€™s built-in time module and demonstrates basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
